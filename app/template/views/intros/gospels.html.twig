    <h4>Summaries for the Gospels - The first four books of the New Testament, four accounts of the life and teachings of Jesus Christ</h4>

    Critical scholarship acknowledges that the Gospels in the New Testament represent a blend of historical events, traditional narratives, and legendary elements, all shaped by their authors' theological perspectives. Each Gospel focuses on Jesusâ€™ teachings, ministry, life, death, and resurrection. Our summaries aim to present their core narratives, without asserting historical accuracy or resolving theological interpretations.
