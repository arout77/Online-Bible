    <h4>Summaries for the Major Prophets - Larger prophetic works in the Old Testament</h4>

    Critical scholars approach the major prophetic books of the Old Testament by situating them within their historical contexts, rather than interpreting them through the lens of Christian messianic prophecies. In our objective summaries, we focus on the narrative content of these texts, steering clear of anachronistic perspectives and emphasizing their original historical and cultural settings.
