Word of God Ministries
==========
This project aims to provide free access to various Christian based services, such as an online Bible (currently available versions are several English translations, the Spanish Reina Valeria 1909 version, a French Louis Segond 1910 version and the German 1912 Luther version), fellowship via a community message board, bible study tools and entertaining and informative animated videos.

### PROJECT STATUS
Coding and web design is near completion. Testing and adding content is currently in progress. The website is expected to go live by the end of August, 2024.

### LOOKING FOR VOLUNTEERS TO ADD CONTENT
The community boards is a forum-style message board powered by phpBB3. Currently, it is completely empty; categories and forums have been created and set up, but lacks content. If you're interested in volunteering to add content, regardless of your religious affiliation, please contact me at andrew_rout@yahoo.com for more details.
